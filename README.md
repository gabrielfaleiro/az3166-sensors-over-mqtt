# az3166-sensors-over-mqtt

az3166 temperature sensor is not valid since the on-board device measures board temperature rather than air temperature.

az3166 can be used for robotics using their embedded accelerometers, gyros and compass to connect with ROS2. Please, see the following project: https://micro.ros.org/
- Already built Arduino ROS2 integration: https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/libraries/ros2arduino/
